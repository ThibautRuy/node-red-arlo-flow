# node-red-arlo-flow
A very simple set of flows to :
- Connect to Arlo API
- Get user-id, deviceId,
- start recording with a camera (tested on Arlo go, feel free to use it with other models and give feedback)

This was inspired by https://git.lehouerou.net/laurent/arlo-go and https://robertogallea.com/posts/development/netgear-arlo-system-api

Feedback welcome!
